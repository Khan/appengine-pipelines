Google App Engine Pipeline API
==============================

Official site: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-pipelines

The Google App Engine Pipeline API connects together complex,
workflows (including human tasks). The goals are flexibility,
workflow reuse, and testability.

A primary use-case of the API is connecting together various
App Engine MapReduces into a computational pipeline.

When making changes to this repository and updating substates,
make sure to use the `master_with_khan_patches` branch instead
of the `master` branch; this has important fixes that our code
relies upon. (The good news is that tests will fail should you
happen to forget this!)
